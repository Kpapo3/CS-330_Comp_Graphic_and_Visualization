Reflection

How do I approach designing software?

In designing software, I focus on understanding the requirements and breaking down the project into manageable components. This project helped me craft new design skills, particularly in creating complex 3D models and applying textures and lighting effectively. I followed a structured design process, starting with conceptual sketches and moving to detailed modeling and texturing. These tactics can be applied in future work to ensure a thorough and organized approach to software design.


How do I approach developing programs?

Developing programs involves iterative testing and refinement. For the 3D scene, I used new development strategies, such as incremental development and frequent testing, to ensure each component functioned correctly. Iteration was crucial, allowing me to refine textures and lighting for realism. My approach to developing code evolved through the milestones, leading to a more polished and complete project.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science, particularly computational graphics and visualizations, provides new knowledge and skills applicable to both my educational and professional pathways. These skills enhance my ability to create visually compelling and interactive applications, which are valuable in various tech industry roles. Understanding graphics and visualization opens opportunities in game development, simulation, and other fields requiring visual representation of data.
